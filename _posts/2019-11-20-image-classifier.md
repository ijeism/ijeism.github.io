Much of the latest technological innovation is based on computer vision — the science behind how computers can make sense of digital images or videos. Indeed, fairly recent breakthroughs in the field of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) — a powerful technology specializing in computer vision tasks — are the main drivers behind the explosion of new and improved tools used in self-driving cars, facial recognition applications, and medical diagnostic imaging. And use cases abound across industries.

Maritime transport is one example where computer vision in used to optimize various operations. Vessel image recognition and recording systems support automated monitoring of ships and other maritime surveillance actions. Examples include detecting illegal activities in the oceans such as piracy, smuggling, pollution, and illegal fishing.

In this post, I demonstrate how to quickly build a very simple binary Image Classifier trained only on images from Planet satellite images that are labelled either ‘ship’ (1000 images) or ‘no-ship’ (3000 images). I use Google Colab and Tensorflow to build a simple CNN that is able to recognise satellite images of ships with an accuracy of 99%.
